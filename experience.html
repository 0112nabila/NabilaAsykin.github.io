      <h2>Project 1</h2>
      <p>I used to work as a theater artist at IPC KOTA DAMANSARA, when I was on semester leave. there I can add new knowledge and meet many different customers but that is one of the good experiences</p>

      <h2>Project 2</h2>
      <p>being a student who lives outside of college is also very challenging with the high cost of living and the rising prices of goods, so I work temporarily when I have free time at the Kedah Halal foods festival booth that takes place in front of Amanjaya Mall.</p>
